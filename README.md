# Duelyst-Game

This project, developed as part of a course at the University of Glasgow, is a tactical card game that combines traditional card-game mechanics with a chess-like board. The project's primary focus was to implement the back-end in Java (front-end provided), which drives the game mechanics, player actions, and game state management.

## Features
- Turn-based gameplay where players draw cards, summon units, and attack opponents.
- Resource management system (mana) to strategically play cards and summon units.
- Dynamic game state that adjusts based on player actions.
